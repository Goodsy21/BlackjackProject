# BLACKJACK PROJECT

## DESCRIPTION
This OOP mimics the card game Blackjack. It's a heads up game that puts you vs the dealer, whoever gets closest to 21 without going over, wins. A blackjack is when you hit 21 with your first two cards, you can not lose with a blackjack hand, but you can tie (push) if the dealer also has a blackjack. It also makes sure there are enough cards in the deck after each hand is dealt and it will replace the deck as needed.

## LESSONS LEARNED# BlackjackProject
Creating methods on the go is so helpful! Don't pre-create them because you code may change along the way and you'll have to backtrack a bunch to fix things. 
Eric helped me understand the flow of OOP, it's still very tricky but the more I use it the better I'll get. I hope.
